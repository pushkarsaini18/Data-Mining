# Data-Mining
The objective of this project is to extract textual data articles from URLs and perform text analysis to compute variables.

## Data Extraction:
For each of the articles extract the article text and save the extracted article in a text file with URL_ID as its file name.
While extracting text, make sure your program extracts only the article title and the article text. It should not extract the website header, footer, or anything other than the article text.

## Data Analysis
For each of the extracted texts from the article, perform textual analysis and compute variables. You need to save the output in CSV format.
